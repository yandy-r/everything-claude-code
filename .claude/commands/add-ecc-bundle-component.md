# /add-ecc-bundle-component

Use this workflow when working on **add-ecc-bundle-component** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new component to the everything-claude-code ECC bundle, such as skill definitions, identity, or command documentation.

## Common Files

- `.claude/ecc-tools.json`
- `.claude/skills/everything-claude-code/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/everything-claude-code/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/identity.json`
- `.claude/commands/feature-development.md`
- `.claude/commands/add-ecc-bundle-component.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or update a file under a relevant ECC bundle directory (e.g., .claude/skills/everything-claude-code/, .agents/skills/everything-claude-code/, .claude/identity.json, .claude/commands/)
- Commit the file with a message referencing the ECC bundle

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
